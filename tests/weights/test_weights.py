Black Thunder could refer to different things depending on the context. Here are a few possibilities:

Amusement Park: Black Thunder could refer to an amusement park. There's a famous water theme park in Tamil Nadu, India, called Black Thunder, known for its water rides and entertainment attractions.
Military Operations: Sometimes, military operations or exercises are given code names. "Black Thunder" might be the name of a specific military operation conducted by a particular country's armed forces.
Film or Media: There might be movies, books, or other media with the title "Black Thunder." It could be a novel, film, or series with a plot related to action, adventure, or a specific theme.
Nickname or Alias: It might also be a nickname or alias used by an individual or a group for various purposes. It could be in reference to someone's personality, actions, or a particular event.
Without additional context, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact reference to "Black Thunder." If you have more details or a specific context in mind, I could provide more accurate information.

"Yellow lightning" typically refers to a type of lightning that appears to have a yellowish or amber hue during a thunderstorm. Lightning usually appears as a bright flash or streak in the sky during a thunderstorm due to the discharge of electricity between clouds or between a cloud and the ground.

The color of lightning can vary depending on various factors, such as atmospheric conditions, the presence of particles or gases in the air, or the distance between the observer and the lightning strike. Lightning often appears as white or bluish-white, but it can also exhibit different colors like yellow, orange, or even red.

The yellowish or amber hue in lightning might be caused by the scattering of light through a greater distance due to atmospheric conditions or the presence of particles. However, the exact reason for the yellow coloration in lightning can vary and is still an area of study among meteorologists and atmospheric scientists.
